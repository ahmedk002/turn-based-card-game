## Project Information
A turn-based card game where you use your deck to defeat an enemy creature that is barring your way. 
You can summon creatures, buff their damage, heal them, and weaken the enemy creature's damage. You can 
also use spells to directly damage the enemy creature. You must defeat the creature to attain glorious victory! 
If all your creatures are defeated, you will be forced to retreat in ignominious defeat, and if you lose all 
your health, you will DIE!
