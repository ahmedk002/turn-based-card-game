## Project Information
A turn-based card game where you use your deck to defeat an enemy creature that is barring your way. 
You can summon creatures, buff their damage, heal them, and weaken the enemy creature's damage. You can 
also use spells to directly damage the enemy creature. You must defeat the creature to attain glorious victory! 
If all your creatures are defeated, you will be forced to retreat in ignominious defeat, and if you lose all 
your health, you will DIE!

## How to run it
The game is run using the CardGameApplication file. You will be presented with a screen with an enemy creature. Your 
health and that of the enemy creature are listed at the top of the screen. 
At the bottom of the screen, you can see your cards. Creature cards can be used to summon creatures. These creatures will 
appear on the left side of the screen and will attack the enemy creature every turn. Attack cards allow you to deal damage 
directly to the creature as well. Finally, status cards can apply buffs to your roster of summoned creatures, or debuff 
the enemy. These buffs include heals and damage increases, while the debuff is a decrease to the enemy's damage. 
You can have a maximum of four cards in your hand, and can play one card every turn. If you wish to skip your turn, you 
may do so by clicking the "skip turn" button next to your hand.
